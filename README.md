# The Investor - a static website project
---
## What's this?
A static website with no database or back-end whatsoever. It's a project purely for learning experience.
## What's The Investor?
A fictional financial magazine company website. 
## How was this created?
This is one of my first tries at writing a static website with some responsive CSS grid and a UI that's using JavaScript. The JS files for the UI are in /script/.
The attempt to use Handlebars.js and Mustache.js on the News page (news.html) aims to use JSON and a template to generate html onto the page. The news.js file inside /partials/ has this logic.
## Are the used assets copyrighted?
I've aimed to use free images from a few websites. the "image attributions.xlsx" file contains all the image sources. Thanks again for those creators!
